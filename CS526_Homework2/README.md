**Homework2**

**Q1**: The answer is in the Q1.txt

**Q2**: The Node class is defined to create nodes. The doIt function is to print the node values in reverse order. The code can be run by entering the command “python3 Q2.py” to see the output of doIt function with sample input(the linked list with 12, 3, 5, 2) 

**Q3**: The code can be run by entering the command “python3 Q3.py”.

**Q4**: This file defines the Node class and DoublyLinkedList class. Node has attributes of its own value, its previous node and its next node. DoublyLinkedList is composed of nodes that has head and tail, and it has the size attribute. DoublyLinkedList has an append function to add a new node to its tail.

The calcSum function is to calculate the sum of the three middle nodes. In this function, I assume the length(size) of the doubly linked list must be at least 3 and odd. If the size equals 3, it will return the sum of the nodes; if the size is larger than 3, the function will recursively drop the head and tail until the size reaches 3.

The code can be run by entering the command “python3 Q4.py”. The test code contains 3 examples.
