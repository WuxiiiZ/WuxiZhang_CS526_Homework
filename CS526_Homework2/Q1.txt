If we use a tail pointer in a linked list, 
it will be easier to insert new nodes. 
For a linked list without a tail pointer, 
a new node insertion requires traversing the whole linked list which takes O(n) time; 
however, with a tail pointer, 
we only need O(1) to find the tail pointer and then append new node after the current tail.
